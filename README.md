# AsmVis - Assembly Visualizer

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

- “AsmVis”, an assembly interpreter used to simulate assembly instructions into processes that manipulate CPU registers stored as Javascript objects. Users can login, save and share snippets of assembly-like code, and interpret the snippets on the website using client-side Javascript. Includes visualizations as instructions are parsed, such as viewing register values as the user steps through.

### CORE FEATURES:

- Users can type, then run or step through programs written in an assembly-like syntax in a code editor.

- Users can visualize CPU register values in real time the program is stepped through.

- Users can save and share code snippets.

- Users can delete code snippets from their accounts.

- Syntax highlighting / parsing errors

- Support for arithmetic functions

- Instruction counter

- Bitwise operations

- Jump operations
